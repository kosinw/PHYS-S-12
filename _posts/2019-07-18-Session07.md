### Magnetic Field
In this section, Rob and Nathan spoke about various sensors (or electronic input devices). The first among these is the Hall Sensor. The Hall Sensor (or Hall effect sensor) is a device that outputs a voltage proprotional to the magnetic field strength passing through it. In this way it acts as a variable voltage divider where the variable is controlled by the magnitude of the magnetic field. However, noise from the Earth's natural gravitational field may mess up with circuits that require detecting a difference in field strength of small magnitudes. Common workarounds for this problem includes [amplifying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier) the signal (which is more difficult to do with the tools available to us in the lab) or the more probable technique, [signal averaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_averaging).

Signal averaging is a techinque common in analyzing data from sensors to help decrease the influence of noise on the data, this technique consists of sampling a fixed number of data points and then averaging them before doing further high level analysis. However, this technique may not be as useful for applications where noise may be more indistinguishable from changes in the signal.

### Light
Phototransistors are transistors whose gate is controlled by the wavelength of EM radiation that passes through it. Some phototransistors react to certain EM radiation within the visible light spectrum, while others react with EM radiation within the infrared spectrum. The output voltage of the phototransistor is just a function of the resistance in series after the transistor and the current; therefore, the output voltage can be effectively controlled by changing the value of the resistor connected in series to the phototransistor.

Photoresistors are more complex in concept; however, they have similar use case. Photoresistors changes in resistance dependant on the wavelength of EM radiation that passes through it. Usually a photoresistor would be used as R2 in the voltage divider circuit in order to produce an output voltage (similar to the phototransistor configuration) and the output voltage would increase as the resistance increases which occurs when the resistor detects less light. Therefore the level of light passing through the resistor is inversely proportional to the output voltage of the voltage divider.

### Temperature
The MCP9700 analog temperature sensor outputs an analog signal out of its V<sub>out</sub> middle pin that is linearly related to temperature.

### Capacitance
In the prior lab section, Rob had requested that each student cut out two copper pads and solder a jumper capable to each one. These two pads were supposed to model those in all capacitors.

Capacitors are an electronic component known as a passive component (i.e. a component that does not actively draw current). Capacitors create capacitance which is a phonemon which stores charge between two plates by creating a potential of positive ions (connected to V<sub>cc</sub> or higher voltage) against negative ions (connected to GND or lower voltage). This property can be useful for applications such as [frequency filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)) which protects fragile ICs from sudden changes in voltage, as [bypass capacitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling_capacitor) which acts as localized power sources for small parts of a circuit, [RC circuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_circuit), pressure sensors, accelerometers, or [capacitive touch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitive_sensing).

The first use case Rob showed for the capacitive, copper pads was detecting the distance between them using tx-rx, which ends up charging and discharging the makeshift "capacitor" made by the two plates, and can be used to detect their distance due to the differences in Q (charge) resultant in distance.

Here is the sample program that Rob provided:
```cpp

//rx_tx02  Robert Hart Mar 2019.
//  Program to use transmit-receive across space between two conductors.
//  One conductor attached to pin4, one to A0
//
//  Optionally, two resistors (1 MOhm or greater) can be placed between 5V and GND, with
//  the signal connected between them so that the steady-state voltage is 2.5 Volts.
//
//  Signal varies with electric field coupling between conductors, and can
//  be used to measure many things related to position, overlap, and intervening material
//  between the two conductors.
//



int read_high;
int read_low;
int diff;
long int sum;
int N_samples = 100;    //Number of samples to take.  Larger number slows it down, but reduces scatter.

void setup() {
pinMode(4,OUTPUT);      //Pin 4 provides the voltage step
Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {

 sum = 0;

 for (int i = 0; i < N_samples; i++){
   digitalWrite(4,HIGH);              //Step the voltage high on conductor 1.
   read_high = analogRead(A0);        //Measure response of conductor 2.
   delayMicroseconds(100);            //Delay to reach steady state.
   digitalWrite(4,LOW);               //Step the voltage to zero on conductor 1.
   read_low = analogRead(A0);         //Measure response of conductor 2.
   diff = read_high - read_low;       //desired answer is the difference between high and low.
   sum += diff;                       //Sums up N_samples of these measurements.
 }
Serial.println(sum);
//delay(100);
}
```

The other use case for the capacitive pads Rob demonstrated was for capacitive touch. Capacitive touch works as detecting a higher voltage when a human being or any other grounded conductor comes into contact with the pad as the other conductive surface will act as a capacitor plate and discharge electrical signal into an analog pin.

## Sound
Although not an input device, the piezo buzzer was an interesting toy to play with. The Piezo Buzzer is connected to a PWM pin and can play a sound of a certain frequency and duration using the builtin Arduino function: `tone(pin, frequency, duration)`;

Here is the code I used to play a tone in relation to when I pressed the capacitive pad:
```cpp
#include <CapacitiveSensor.h>

CapacitiveSensor Sensor = CapacitiveSensor(7,5);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
}

void loop() {
  long sensorValue = Sensor.capacitiveSensor(300);
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  tone(2, sensorValue, 10);
  delay(10);
}
  
```
