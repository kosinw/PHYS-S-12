### 3D Printing
In its early stages, 3D printing was highly romanticized. Marketed as a product that will bring about the prospect of consumers cutting out the middleman and being 100% self-sufficient. However, 3D printing has many short comings that will its technology will not be able to overcome as long as its known as "3D printing". The process of 3D printing is also known as additive manufacturing, which turns CAD generated models into physical objects which are printed by adding layers on top of each other. 3D printers can use a variety of materials-- one of which is filament and uses a process known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) to extrude melted thermoplastic out of a nozzle and form solid models. Another material used is a powdered material and a process known as selective laser sintering (SLS) to create physical models. Finally, a process known as stereolithography is used in older 3D printers by using a liquid vat for the printing process. In fact the STL file format that is used to generate Gcode is an abbreviation of the stereolithography technique.

#### Slicing
CAD generated models from softwares such as Fusion 360, Tinkercad, or Rhinoceros cannot be directly read and processed by 3D printer software. 3D printers work by printing layer by layer and uses a combination of movement and extrusion assembly instructions to accomplish that task. Therefore, softwares known as slicers have been created for 3D printers which can convert a CAD file (specifically STL files) into assembly instructions that a 3D printer can understand known as Gcode. Gcode is a *family* of assembly instructions, just as computer assembly is; therefore, there is not one Gcode specification but many variations of it that is esoteric to each model of 3D printers.

#### STL file format
Most CAD softwares can export a file format that is supported by slicers known as an STL file. STL files come in binary formats (i.e. non-human readable and cannot be opened by text editors) and ASCII format (i.e. human readable). STL files declare many triangle faces, similar to how computer graphics processors interpret 3D graphics as composites of triangles.

```
facet normal ni nj nk
    outer loop
        vertex v1x v1y v1z
        vertex v2x v2y v2z
        vertex v3x v3y v3z
    endloop
endfacet
```

### 3D Scanning
3D Scanning is an interesting techinque to create CAD generated models from real-life physical objects. In the fabrication lab there is a consumer-grade scanner which is very efficient for scanning things that human-sized (e.g. busts, faces, limbs). However, for objects smaller than that (for instance a watch), the consumer-grade scanner has issues picking up on minor details and even collecting enough information to generate a model. However, more sophisticated scanners exist (e.g. some that cost tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars) that are able to scan objects to the precision of a tenth of a millimeter. 3D scanners use a techinique akin to compositing many 2D photographs taken of an object together and applying certain algorithms to produce a CAD generated model. For this reasons, objects with reflective surfaces are especially difficult to scan. Masking tape or chalk spray can be used to cover up reflective surfaces in order to circumvent this issue.

### 3D Scanning
In this lab section, I immediately tried to scan my wristwatch with the consumer-grade 3D Sense scanner in order to get some starting point for the encolsure for my final project. However, I quickly ran into problems with the 3D scanner responding poorly to the reflective acrylic covering my digital watch's face. I used blue masking tape to cover the face and the eyelets of the watchband in order to produce a better scan. Unfortunately, because of the small size of the wristwatch, it was hard to produce a good scan. I used the builtin tools of the 3D Sense software to erase the watchband and produced this scan:

### Digitizing Probe
Still determine to get some sort of 3D representation of my wristwatch, I attempted another technique that can be used to generate CAD models. The Shopbot CNC mill in the lab can be used with a 3D Digitizing Probe to scan objects. The Digitizing Probe moves in increments specified by the user in the Shopbot program and takes an image of the surface below it; the CNC mill then repeats this process many times in a grid until it has a collection of small images that make up the scanned object. The CNC mill then composites these images together to create a heightmap of the scanned object and exports a DXF (a CAD data file format) which can then be used to generate a 3D model. The generated heightmap is a very coarse, pixelated distortion of the original object since I accidentally configured the mill to move the arm too much when scanning the object.

### 3D Printing
The DXF heightmap in and of itself cannot be used to 3D print an object. I imported the DXF heightmap obtained from the 3D Digitizing Probe into a software known as Rhinoceros. Rhinoceros (or Rhino for short) is a CAD modeling software (similar to Fusion 360) that is created for the purpose of working with realistic objects (not rectangular objects which Fusion was designed in mind for). The heightmap generated an object known as an open mesh which means that it cannot be used to 3D print since it has open vertices and is not a fully contiguous object. After modification in Rhino, I exported the model as an STL file and opened it up in Ultimaker Cura. Ultimaker Cura is a slicing software that has many options to generate Gcode for various 3D printers, including the Prusa printers which are in the fabrication lab. I generated Gcode for the Prusa i3 Mk2 and uploaded the code to an SD card. After ~15 minutes of heating up and printing, I was able to recreate an object succesfully using 3D printing.
