## Portable Drum Kit (CIMBAL)
After realizing the issues of creating a smartwatch that requires small electronics, I concluded that constructing a quality final project was infeasible in the remaining time left of the course.

I have concluded on starting a new project: a portable drum kit. This drum kit will allow users to use socks and gloves to control each component of a drum kit. Through the MIDI protocol, an [Adafruit Circuit Playground](#12a) will communicate with the [Hydrogen Drums software](http://hydrogen-music.org/) which reads MIDI input and translates it to percussive instruments.

After using a [machine-learning AI to generate product/brand based on keywords](https://namelix.com/#), I have aptly named this project CIMBAL.

### BOM
Electronic components needed include three or four [Arduino Nano boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoNano), one [Adafruit Circuit Playground](https://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=category&cPath=888), two times the amount of RF24/radio modules than Arduino Nano's boards, and six or ten piezoelectric sensors or capacitive touch sensors (whichever ones work better). Conductive thread and wires are also needed to connect circuitry. An I2C OLED display for stats on MIDI devices. A USB micro-B connector to connect the Circuit Playground as a MIDI device and mini USB to program each Arduino Nano board.

### Diagrams
[Figure 12B](#12b) outlines the transmitter circuits for the socks and the glove(s). The sock diagram shows that a piezoelectric sensor / capacitive touch sensor on the bottom of the sock which will be read by an Arduino Nano or microcontroller and transmit data to the receiever circuit using an RF24 circuit. The RF24, sensor, 3.3V coin cell, and micrcontroller will all be sewn onto the sock and connected through conductive thread. The glove diagram shows something similar to the sock diagram, however; it uses multiple piezos / capacitive touch sensors which each correlate to a specific drum. [Figure 12C](#12c) outlines the receiver circuit for the [Circuit Playground](#12a) and its enclosure to the laptop. The circuit will contain a potentiometer to be used for volume control, an OLED display to display information on the volume and instrument used currently, and an RF24 receiver module. The circuit will fit in a box CNC milled enclosure (or 3D printed) created from some sort of wood hopefully.

### Circuits
[Figure 12D](#12d) outlines the transmitter circuits and the receiver circuits.

### Inspiration
- [Fruit Drums](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-fruit-drums/overview): A project that uses the Circuit Playground to transform fruits into MIDI drums.
