# Portable Drum Kit (CIMBAL)
After realizing the issues of creating a smartwatch that requires small electronics, I concluded that constructing a quality final project was infeasible in the remaining time left of the course.

I have concluded on starting a new project: a portable drum kit. This drum kit will allow users to use socks and gloves to control each component of a drum kit. Through the MIDI protocol, an [Adafruit Circuit Playground](#12a) will communicate with the [Hydrogen Drums software](http://hydrogen-music.org/) which reads MIDI input and translates it to percussive instruments.

After using a [machine-learning AI to generate product/brand based on keywords](https://namelix.com/#), I have aptly named this project CIMBAL.

### Initial BOM
Electronic components needed include three or four [Arduino Nano boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoNano), one [Adafruit Circuit Playground](https://www.adafruit.com/index.php?main_page=category&cPath=888), two times the amount of RF24/radio modules than Arduino Nano's boards, and six or ten piezoelectric sensors or capacitive touch sensors (whichever ones work better). Conductive thread and wires are also needed to connect circuitry. An I2C OLED display for stats on MIDI devices. A USB micro-B connector to connect the Circuit Playground as a MIDI device and mini USB to program each Arduino Nano board.

### Diagrams
[Figure 12B](#12b) outlines the transmitter circuits for the socks and the glove(s). The sock diagram shows that a piezoelectric sensor / capacitive touch sensor on the bottom of the sock which will be read by an Arduino Nano or microcontroller and transmit data to the receiever circuit using an RF24 circuit. The RF24, sensor, 3.3V coin cell, and micrcontroller will all be sewn onto the sock and connected through conductive thread. The glove diagram shows something similar to the sock diagram, however; it uses multiple piezos / capacitive touch sensors which each correlate to a specific drum. [Figure 12C](#12c) outlines the receiver circuit for the [Circuit Playground](#12a) and its enclosure to the laptop. The circuit will contain a potentiometer to be used for volume control, an OLED display to display information on the volume and instrument used currently, and an RF24 receiver module. The circuit will fit in a box CNC milled enclosure (or 3D printed) created from some sort of wood hopefully.

### Circuits
[Figure 12D](#12d) outlines the transmitter circuits and the receiver circuits.

### Inspiration
- [Fruit Drums](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuit-playground-fruit-drums/overview): A project that uses the Circuit Playground to transform fruits into MIDI drums.

## Update (2019, July 29)

### Microcontrollers
During the Tuesday section, Rob introduced two new Arduino development boards that use a different microcontroller than the ATMega328P (which is found in the Arduino Uno, Pro Mini, and Nano). These two boards are the [Arduino Micro](#12e) and [Arduino Pro Micro](#12f) and both use the [ATMega32u4](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32U4). The main functional difference for using the ATMega32u4 over the ATMega328p is the fact that the 32u4 has built-in USB support. This allows for (meaningful) difference in my project and the [Micro](#12e) can be used as a USB MIDI device. In addition, I am dropping the use of the Adafruit Circuit Playground due to difficulty as using as a prototype and lack of pins.

### Sensors
After some pondering, I realized that both the piezoelectric sensors and capacitive touch sensors may not work most efficiently for wearable electronics projects. The piezoelectric sensors are very fragile so they are prone to breaking easily plus the piezos found in the lab are too large to fit on the pad of a finger. Capactiive touch sensors are very unreliable (without an external module like the Adafruit MPR121) and the static generated from fabric will interfere with the capacitance of the sensor. Thankfully, pioneers in the weararble electronics market have invented [velostat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velostat), a fabric that is electrically conductive and can be used as a (relatively) inexprensive pressure sensor for shoes. [This](https://learn.adafruit.com/firewalker-led-sneakers/make-velostat-step-sensors) Adafruit project shows an example of how velostat can be used to detect pressure.

### Radios
In today's [section]({{ "/09#2019-july-29-monday-lab" | prepend : site.baseurl }}), I was able to get an 328P transmitter to communicate with a 32u4 receiver; therefore, future progress must be made where I implement some sort of [OSI, packet-based communication protocol like TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) where one 32u4 receiver can communicate with multiple 32u4 transmitters. This can be implemented using the [RF24Network](https://github.com/nRF24/RF24Network) library hopefully.

### Modelling
Today, I modelled a rudimentary version of the [RX diagram](#12h) without any text and fancy featuers. So far it lacks snap fitting (which I plan to implement by the end of Wednesday's Lab), text features, and some sort of power switch. The case itself is quite rudimentary, only being a knob with a circular extrusion (not able to design a knob that fits a potentiometer exactly). Hopefully I will be able to 3D print each part of the model and get a working receiver diagram by the end of Wedensday's Lab (i.e., 2019, July 31).

## Update (2019, August 1)

### Sensors
As a result of Wednesday's Lab section (2019, July 31), I became increasingly frustrated and hopeless on using velostat and sewing. This frustration was primarily a result of a combination of sewing inexperience, light-headedness from inhaling solder fumes for an 1:30-2:00 hours straight, messy taping, and repetitive experiments yielding no results. As a result, I have decided to use photoresistors encircled by light-blocking foam to detect proximity of each finger tip. This foam could be EVA or any other type of foam in the lab. Each photoresistor will have a common 3.3V line and each output line would be tied to a 10k resistor. The foam will be glued to the glove in some way (either sewn on?? or hot-glued).

## Update (Weekend 2019, August 2 -  2019, August 4)

### Failures
Over this weekend, **many**, **many** failures ensued both in the case of the receiver circuit and the transmitter circuit. Both attempts to 3D print [this](#12h) model ended up in a jumbled mess on the Prusa printer. I theorize that this mess is due to the stepper motor knocking around the PLA plastic before it could properly solidify and stick to the Prusa's printer plate.

Over this weekend, I created a total of 2 failed attempts and an in-process attempt of creating a glove which reads sensor inputs. The first two attempts used the turkey glove method (i.e. [tracing my hand on a piece of paper](#12i) and cutting out two elastic fabric pieces) to try to create a glove. These gloves would have [piezoelectric sensors](#12l) patched onto the inside of each finger and would connect to an Adafruit Circuit Playground sewed onto the back of the glove. Before the first attempt, I had a test run of sewing fabric together and created a [sample finger](#12j). The first attempt, I attempted to use the sewing machine to [stitch together the two pieces of fabric.](#12m) However, due to the movement of the feed dogs and the overall difficulty in controlling the difficulty of the fabric movement, the glove had malformed stitches and not enough seam allowance to allow the fingers to move without cutting thru the stitches. The [second attempt](#12k), I began with ths same process as the first attempt; however, I was unable to cut enough fabric to compensate for the seam allowance and the sides of the elastic glove-- this would result in the glove being too small. However, uncognizant of this matter, I then cut out a portion of my Nike Dri-FIT<sup>TM</sup> gym shirt for more elastic fabric. The second attempt I stitched [patches](#12l) on before stitching the two faces of the glove in order to make space for the piezoelectric sensors which would respond to touch. When I got around to stitching the two halves of the glove together, I hand sewed around this time to avoid the issues with the glove shape from the first attempt. Hand-sewing patches and the glove together took upwards of 4-5 hours for a novice to sewing such as myself, making the failed attempt much more painful. The current attempt, I am using the Black + Decker hardware gloves I purchased the previous weekend. I successfully sewed the Adafruit Circuit Playground to the back of the glove; however, the thickness of the cloth makes it difficult to sew patches onto the fingers of the glove. Super glue, although a messy solution, may be a way to attach the patches to the glove without losing a finger or two and conserving time.

### Successes
Of the **many**, **many** failed attempts this weekend, very few successes came around. One such success was the succesful creation of the CIMBAL RX model (despite the results of the 3D printing). The enclosure is a cylindrical container which features a snap-fit lid and extruded acrylic which diffuses RGB LEDs. The size of the acrylic donut on the lid was parametrically designed around the [Adafruit NeoPixel Ring](#12n) LED array I found lying in the lab. Another success includes creating and organizing a [new box to hold my final project](#12o) which is more compact and less cluttered than my previous box. The final and last success, was creating a sample program which corresponds to pressing a button on the Adafruit Circuit Playground to generating a MIDI note. When the button is pressed, a kick drum note (#36 in MIDI protocol) is generated and synthesized into sound by a [software synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_synthesizer). I used a free trial of a professional software synthesizer-- [Ableton Live Studio 10](#12p) to test my MIDI input device. <a download href="./sketch_aug02a.ino">Here</a> is the code I used to acheive the aforementioned behavior:

```cpp
#include <Adafruit_CircuitPlayground.h>
#include "MIDIUSB.h"

#define DEBOUNCE 500

const int button = 4;

boolean activated(uint8_t sensor) {
  return digitalRead(sensor) == HIGH;  
}

void matchDrum(uint8_t sensor) {
  Serial.print("SENSOR: "); 
  Serial.println(sensor);
  Serial.print("Sending MIDI: ");

  switch (sensor) {
    case button:
      Serial.println("36. Kick drum.");
      playDrum(36);
      break;
    default:
      Serial.println("INVALID NOTE");
  }
}

void noteOn(byte channel, byte pitch, byte velocity) {
  midiEventPacket_t noteOn = {0x09, 0x90 | channel, pitch, velocity};
  MidiUSB.sendMIDI(noteOn);
}

void noteOff(byte channel, byte pitch, byte velocity) {
  midiEventPacket_t noteOff = {0x08, 0x80 | channel, pitch, velocity};
  MidiUSB.sendMIDI(noteOff);
}

void playDrum(byte drum) {
  noteOn(9, drum, 125);
  MidiUSB.flush();
  noteOff(9, drum, 0);
  MidiUSB.flush();
}

void setup() {
  // Initialize serial.
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Set inbuilt button to read input.
  pinMode(button, INPUT);

  // Initialize Circuit Playground library.
  CircuitPlayground.begin();
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  if (activated(button)) {
    // Play appropriate drum sound.
    matchDrum(button);

    // Add debounce to avoid continous sensor reading.
    delay(DEBOUNCE);
  }
}
```

## Update (2019, August 5 - 2019, August 7)
Over the course of Monday - Thursday lab sections, I was able to finish sewing + attaching the piezoelectric to the glove. In addition, I was able to succesfully 3D print the enclosure for the receiver circuit and attempt to get the NeoPixel Ring to work. 

I used epoxy adhesive to glue pieces of velcro to the end of each digit (excluding the thumb) on the glove. I then soldered two leads to each piezoelectric sensor and enclosed it in the velcro. I solder the black lead of each piezo to the ground pin on the Adafruit Circuit Playground; for the red leads, I soldered each one to a separate analog pin according to [this pinout](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-circuit-playground/pinouts).

To measure if I soldered the piezos correctly (i.e. not shorting the ceramic material and the outside plate together), I used an [oscilliscope](#12q) to properly test if a signal is generated. Thankfully, each time I soldered the connections, it generated a signal on the first time. However, using the oscilliscope, I discovered three main issues: one, the movement of the wires affects the signal generated; two, all of the sensors are coupled together, therefore a signal is read from a piezo even if that specific piezo isn't generating the signal; and finally three, the piezo sensors are **incredibly** sensisitve to the slightest movement. Unfortantely, I didn't come across an easy solution for the last issue; however, the first issue can be resolved by sewing down the leads of each piezo to avoid the leads from moving around. The second issue can be resolved as the signal generated by other piezo's than the one being read reach lower peaks and higher valleys (i.e. the absolute value of the highest and lowest values will always be lower); therefore, just having a higher threshold (in a program) can solve this issue.

The creation of the receiver circuit (rememeber the purpose of this circuit is to wirelessly receive signals from the glove in order to create wireless ness) was relatively productive. I used transparent PLA filament and the [Ultimaker 2+](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers/ultimaker-2-plus) printer to create a transparent ring that diffuses light from the LEDs of an Adafruit NeoPixel LED ring. Certain LEDs would turn on in response to drum beats and create a nice looking display in addition to the drum effects. I used the <a href="./RGBWstandtest.ino" download>RGBWstrandtest example</a> from the Adafruit NeoPixel examples to test the LEDs:

```cpp
// NeoPixel test program showing use of the WHITE channel for RGBW
// pixels only (won't look correct on regular RGB NeoPixel strips).

#include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>
#ifdef __AVR__
 #include <avr/power.h> // Required for 16 MHz Adafruit Trinket
#endif

// Which pin on the Arduino is connected to the NeoPixels?
// On a Trinket or Gemma we suggest changing this to 1:
#define LED_PIN     6

// How many NeoPixels are attached to the Arduino?
#define LED_COUNT  24

// NeoPixel brightness, 0 (min) to 255 (max)
#define BRIGHTNESS 250

// Declare our NeoPixel strip object:
Adafruit_NeoPixel strip(LED_COUNT, LED_PIN, NEO_GRBW + NEO_KHZ800);
// Argument 1 = Number of pixels in NeoPixel strip
// Argument 2 = Arduino pin number (most are valid)
// Argument 3 = Pixel type flags, add together as needed:
//   NEO_KHZ800  800 KHz bitstream (most NeoPixel products w/WS2812 LEDs)
//   NEO_KHZ400  400 KHz (classic 'v1' (not v2) FLORA pixels, WS2811 drivers)
//   NEO_GRB     Pixels are wired for GRB bitstream (most NeoPixel products)
//   NEO_RGB     Pixels are wired for RGB bitstream (v1 FLORA pixels, not v2)
//   NEO_RGBW    Pixels are wired for RGBW bitstream (NeoPixel RGBW products)

void setup() {
  // These lines are specifically to support the Adafruit Trinket 5V 16 MHz.
  // Any other board, you can remove this part (but no harm leaving it):
#if defined(__AVR_ATtiny85__) && (F_CPU == 16000000)
  clock_prescale_set(clock_div_1);
#endif
  // END of Trinket-specific code.

  strip.begin();           // INITIALIZE NeoPixel strip object (REQUIRED)
  strip.show();            // Turn OFF all pixels ASAP
  strip.setBrightness(50); // Set BRIGHTNESS to about 1/5 (max = 255)
}

void loop() {
  // Fill along the length of the strip in various colors...
  colorWipe(strip.Color(255,   0,   0)     , 50); // Red
  colorWipe(strip.Color(  0, 255,   0)     , 50); // Green

}

// Fill strip pixels one after another with a color. Strip is NOT cleared

// and a delay time (in milliseconds) between pixels.
void colorWipe(uint32_t color, int wait) {
  for(int i=0; i<strip.numPixels(); i++) { // For each pixel in strip...

```

What I ended up discovering, is that only certain LEDs turn on on the ring and that it could only display red hues. Ultimately, I decided to work further on the glove so I could not further debunk this issue. [Here is the final end product with the Arduino Micro and enclosure.](#12s)

Another issue I encountered with the glove, is that some of the epoxy-coated velcro began to peel off. Thankfully, since epoxy is a resin and soldified, I didn't need to apply epoxy or silicone adhesive again. I used a quick curing adhesive known as [rubber cement](#12t). When thin layers are applied on each surface, they cure and form an adhesive and allow for reliable connections without waiting too long.

Unfortunately, due to the fragile nature of the piezoelectric sensors and the massive frustration I encountered with constantly having to replace the piezo sensors due to testing the glove; I have decided to use photoresistors (I know flip-flopping) for my demonstration tomorrow. In order to finish in a reasonable amount of time (only about ~3 hours of lab time remaining), I will only implement the palm as a kick drum sound. Optimally, I would add photoresistors to each finger to represent different drum sounds.
