## Ulysses

### Namesake
Ulysses, better known as Odysseus, is the Greco-Roman hero of the Homer's epic poem The _Odyssey_. Odysseus, despite his many tragic flaws, was most known for his quick wit and  great intellect. The goal of this project is to enhance my personal executive skills and planning; therefore, I named it after the Greco-Roman hero in hopes that this project will help me with time management and overall greater learning exprience.

### The Idea
The idea for my wearable planner would help promote and nurture executive skills and strict, rigid documentation of one's daily routine. This would create an affordable alternative to other smart devices (which frankly come with too much bloated features) that would act in a similar way. The idea for this watch would have capactive touch pads switch between the watches three usable modes: time, appointments, and planner. This alongside a touchscreen would allow the user to interact with notes and appointments they set up on their phone using an application with a similar note taking style to [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/).

### Time
This part of the mockup is self-evident-- it tells you the time. On an app on a phone (which I have decided will be written in either [Vue Native](https://vue-native.io/) and/or [Revery](https://www.outrunlabs.com/revery/)), you will be able to configure if this app tells in military time or 12-hour time.

### Appointments
This part of the device will integrate with the primary portion of this application-- taking notes by allowing the user (i.e. me) to assosciate dates and times with each note entry.

### Notes
The primary and meat of this application-- taking notes. I love the paradigm used by [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/); however, my main issue with it is that it is OSX only. I have used this [Vim plugin](https://github.com/alok/notational-fzf-vim) alongisde [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (honestly the greatest terminal application ever created) for my notetaking needs in Vim. I would love to translate this to a more usable medium using a mobile phone. The idea would be to type up notes using a mobile application and then using bluetooth, the mobile phone would communicate with an [Arduino board](https://arduino.cc) and update the client side with an associative array of note titles and bodies.
