## 2019, July 15 (Monday Lab)
In this section, I built out the various circuits required for the assignment due on Tuesday's section. I built out two circuits that read an input from a button-- one using a button in a pull-up resistor configuration and another using the button in a pull-down resistor configuration.

### Pull-up and pull-down
For certain passive components, such as switches/buttons, they can assume one of three states at a time. In terms of digital logic, a button can either be digital HIGH (1, true, ON, etc..), digital LOW (0, false, OFF, etc...), or some sort of undefined state. As reflected by its schematic diagram, when a switch is receiving no mechanical input the negative terminal is in a "floating" and is picking up the electromagnetic interference which accounts for the seemingly random voltages that carry through the line. In order to combat the Arduino development board's confusion in what the "floating" state is, two configurations are possible to solve this problem.

Example pull-up schematic.

![pulldown_sch](pulldown_sch.jpg)
Example pull-down schematic.

In the pull-up resistor configuration, the voltage drop across the switch is "pulled up" to high and is connected to VCC via a resistor. When the switch is in an untoggled state, the current flows from 5V to D2 and when the switch is pressed, the current instead flows to GND (this configuration, 0 is pressed, 1 is unpressed).

In the pull-down resistor configuration, the floating terminal of the switch is "pulled down" to low and is connected to GND via a resistor. When the switch is an untoggled state, no current is flowing from VCC which causes the D2 pin to read a low. When the switch is pressed, the current flows directly into the D2 pin equalling a high (this configuration, 0 is unpressed, 1 is pressed).

Actual pull-up circuit built out.

Actual pull-down circuit built out.

Here is the sketch I used in both these circuit configurations:

```cpp
/*
  Button

  Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 13,
  when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2.

  The circuit:
  - LED attached from pin 13 to ground
  - pushbutton attached to pin 2 from +5V
  - 10K resistor attached to pin 2 from ground

  - Note: on most Arduinos there is already an LED on the board
    attached to pin 13.

// constants won't change. They're used here to set pin numbers:
const int buttonPin = 2;     // the number of the pushbutton pin
const int ledPin =  13;      // the number of the LED pin

// variables will change:
int buttonState = 0;         // variable for reading the pushbutton status

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize the pushbutton pin as an input:
  pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

void loop() {
  // read the state of the pushbutton value:
  buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);

  // check if the pushbutton is pressed. If it is, the buttonState is HIGH:
  if (buttonState == HIGH) {
    // turn LED on:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } else {
    // turn LED off:
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  }
}
```

### Homework Exercise
For the required exercise due by Tuesday's class session, students are supposed to build a circuit that is supposed to react to some input device while using both an if statement and a for loop. For my homework, I read in the voltage from a potentiometer (or variable divider) wiper and scaled that value from 0 to 100. I then outputed the value to an I2C 128x64 OLED display using the Adafruit_GFX library.

Here is the circuit built out.

Here is a video of the circuit.

Here is the sketch I used to drive this circuit:

```cpp
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>

#define POT 0

#define WIDTH 128
#define HEIGHT 64

#define OLED_RESET -1

Adafruit_SSD1306 display(WIDTH, HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(9600);

    // Initialize display
    if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C))
    {
        Serial.println(F("SSD1306 allocation failed"));
        for (;;)
        {
        } // stuck forever
    }

    // Clear the display of Adafruit logo
    display.clearDisplay();
}

void loop()
{
    int val = analogRead(POT);

    val = map(val, 0, 1023, 0, 100);

    display.clearDisplay();

    display.setTextSize(2);
    display.setCursor(0, 0);
    display.setTextColor(WHITE);
    display.println(val);

    display.display();
}
```
