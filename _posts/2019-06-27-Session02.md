### Microcontrollers
Microcontrollers are ICs (integrated circuits) that act as computers. They contain microprocessors in addition to read-only memory and RAM. Both the Arduino Uno and Nano use ATMega328P, in fact the Arduino hardware is essentially just an easier way to interface with microcontrollers. Microcontrollers use mutliple communications interfaces that are industry standard including I2C and Serial over USB.

### PWM
PWM (pulse-width modulation) is a signal sending technique for digital signals. Analog signals have the capability of being in an interval of logic level high (usually 5V for Arduino) and logic level low (usually GND); however, digital signals, like the ones used in computers can only be a binary value of logic level high or logic level high. PWM allows digital signals to act more like analog signals by switching between logic level high and low in an interval (1/500ths for an Arduino board). The duration in which logic level high is present during this interval is scaled to 0 to 255 (0 = 0%, 255 = 100%).

### Electronics terminology
Current is what flows through a circuit. (A, amperes)

Voltage is the difference in electrical potential between two points in a circuit. (V, volts).

Voltage drop is the difference in voltage lost after current passing through an Ohmic device (i.e. resistor). This can be calculated by using the current from the most recent node and the resistance of the Ohmic device.

Voltage divider is a circuit which outputs a certain voltage which is determined on the ratio between the two resistors used in the circuit. Voltage divider circuits can be **OVERLOADED** which occurs when a resistor of significantly lower value is used as the load to a voltage divider circuit.

### Saws
Saws are used as a manual tool (and usually for finer more nuanced work) when cutting wood, plastic, and metal. When talking about saws, they can usually be subdivided into two major categories: push and pull saws. The two major saws we used for cutting wood are: the Japanese (nokogiri) pull saw and the European push saw. For cutting plastic: the Japanese pull saw and the hacksaw is used.

#### Wood Saws
![push_and_pull](push_and_pull.jpg)

As their names suggest, the push saw cuts the wood on _PUSH_ motion and the pull saw cuts the wood on _PULL_ motion. My personal favorite is the Japanese pull saw as the motion feels more natural rather than the European push saw which often gets caught in the grooves in the wood. However, push saws generally have larger cuts over the ones of the pull saws. The coping saw is another saw used for cutting wood, usually for more finer cuts such as corners.

#### Vises and Clamps
In the lab we saw many types of vises which all have the purpose of holding some material in place for cutting. These acts as a sort of third hand which helps greatly in cutting materials.

#### Plastic Saws
![hack_saw](hack_saw.jpg)

Unsurprisingly, cutting plastic such as acrylic is much more difficult than cutting wood. Cutting plastic requires making scores a`cross before being able to cut properly. The hacksaw (in my opinion) is much more difficult for cutting than the Japanese pull saw because of the direction the teeth of the blade point. The hacksaw is very effective cutting in a more downwards motion.

#### Scroll Saw

Undoubtably the most exciting tool that I learned to use in this section. The scroll saw allows for cutting wood in very precise shapes, especially circular ones. There are mutlitple speed settings that control easy of cutting and degree of control. The higher the setting, the faster the saw will move, and the easier the cut will be. However, adversely moving the wood becomes more difficult as the speed of the saw increases.

### Cutting

For cutting cardboard and thinner woods, a box cutter is used. Evidently, the safety precautions of the box cutter is common sense.

- Don't cut towards yourself, **always** cut away
- Don't brandish or play around with box cutters

### Joining

Usually using a battery drill is sufficient for drilling in screws. There is a switch on each side of the battery drill which toggles if the drill spins clockwise or counterclockwise.
