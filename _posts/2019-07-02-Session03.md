### Autodesk Fusion 360
Autodesk Fusion 360 is what is known as CAD software, a 3D modelling software which allows fabricators and industrial-grade companies to create and design prototypes for hardware components. As a hobbyist, I can apply for a renewable 1-year license as long as I use the software to generate an income under a certain amount. Here is a preview of what the software looks like:

### 2D sketching
Sketches are drawings that are used to develop 3D models. Sketches include real-life representations and specifications for scale such as millimeters. These sketches may include physical boundaries such as definining the borders of an object; however, Fusion 360 includes the concept of construction lines. Construction lines do not have actual physical representations after the CAD is milled, cutted, or CNC'd; however, they allow the user to help create and define their design. Moreover, construction lines play into the concept of parametric design-- a methodology to easily modify physical properties of a CAD design.

### 3D construction
Since this section is on 2D design, one methodology to translate 2D design to 3D is through press-fit construction. Press-fit construction relies on printing many small geometrical components in order to compose a larger design. Typically, these gemoetrical shapes are just simple extrusions of 2D geometry (represented as sketches in Fusion 360) which makes them easy to create over full-fledged 3D models. However, a very important aspect to keep in mind with press-fit construction is how the pieces will fit together in the real world. Due to the kerf of the laser cutter, there is some variation in the actual dimesnions of the press-fit components when printed out. Therefore, fillets need to be introduced. Fillets are rounded edges which allow press-fit components to fit together more tightly.

#### Laser cutting
Perhaps the most fun and interesting part of this section is the laser cutting. However, before getting to play with lasers, safety precautions must be considered first. Fires can and may occur while the laser cutter is operating so shutting off the ventilation and activating the emergency stop function on the laser cutter should be the first priority. The chemicals from laser cutting is a consideration as well. Always use materials that don't produce toxic byproduct such as cardboard, acrylic, or wood. However, **never, ever** use PVC (polyvinyl chloride) in the laser cutter as it produces the **highly toxic** chlorine gas. Even small exposure to chlorine gas can lead to serious side-effects such as death, so proceed with caution. To operate the laser cutter, export a DXF file from a Fusion 360 component and upload that to the Alienware workstation next to the laser cutter. Then, use the ThunderLaser software to layer out the DXF and set the laser focus, speed, and focus values.

### Vinyl cutter

The vinyl cutter is a machine that cuts into vinyl (in the case of this section's lab, adhesive-backed) with a small blade that protrudes out of a moving arm. The vinyl printer uses a software created by MIT for Neil Gershenfeld's HMAA course. A Node.js server must be started on the host machine that is directly connected to the cutter. Then, the client must be started that allows a vector image path to be selected. In addition, the client allows the user to set the force used by the blade and the threshold in which determines what the printer prints as an outline.

### Laser cutting
The laser cutter was used to cut out press-fit circles in this section.

Parametric design was used to construct a press-fit circle with notches.

The width of the notches was calculated by using the thickness of the cardboard and subtracting the kerf of the laser. The thickness of the carboard, the number of notches, the radius of the fillets, and the diameter of the press-fit component is represented in CAD software by user-defined variables.

A ThunderLaser printer was used to cut out cardboard. DXF files exported from Fusion360 are uploaded and arrayed onto the ThunderLaser software.

Here is an example of how my press-fit circles can be used.
