## 2019, July 10 (Wednesday Lab)

In this section, I recieved the 128x64 OLED display that Rob had ordered last week. This specific part uses I2C/IIC (pronounced I _squared_ C) communication as a way to communicate with the Arduino development board.

### I2C
The I2C/IIC protocol is a way for multiple devices to communicate only using 2 lines for communication. I2C uses a master-slave model for communication; i.e., one or more master devices can unilaterally modify one or more slave devices. In other terms, slave devices are unable to modify/control a master device; however, a master device can modify/control slave devices. I2C slave devices have unique addresses that are mapped to a bus. These addresses can either be 7 bits (0x7F is the max value) or 10 bits long (0x3FF is the max value). The names of the lines used in I2C are SDA (for data) and SCL (for clock), I2C is common in the Arduino world for the few number of lines used and how multiple slave devices can be connected to the same bus.

### Controlling the OLED
After unpacking the OLED display, I followed the datasheet that came along with the display to wire it up to an Arduino Uno development board. I connected the SCL line (a.k.a the blue wire) to the analog input pin A5 and I connected the SDA line (a.k.a the green wire) to the analog input pin A4. VCC and GND were connected accordingly to the development board as well. Here is how it was wired:

### Discovering the I2C address
Each I2C slave device has a hard-coded address when accessing it through the address bus. Surprisingly, the datasheet that came along with the OLED display had only mentioned that the display had used a 2-wire I2C protocol (which was already obvious from the pins labeled SCL and SDA on the display), but nothing about the physical address. Luckily, the Arduino developers have created a program that prints out the address of all discovered I2C slave devices on a serial monitor.

```cpp
 // --------------------------------------
// i2c_scanner
//
// Version 1
//    This program (or code that looks like it)
//    can be found in many places.
//    For example on the Arduino.cc forum.
//    The original author is not know.
// Version 2, Juni 2012, Using Arduino 1.0.1
//     Adapted to be as simple as possible by Arduino.cc user Krodal
// Version 3, Feb 26  2013
//    V3 by louarnold
// Version 4, March 3, 2013, Using Arduino 1.0.3
//    by Arduino.cc user Krodal.
//    Changes by louarnold removed.
//    Scanning addresses changed from 0...127 to 1...119,
//    according to the i2c scanner by Nick Gammon
//    https://www.gammon.com.au/forum/?id=10896
// Version 5, March 28, 2013
//    As version 4, but address scans now to 127.
//    A sensor seems to use address 120.
// Version 6, November 27, 2015.
//    Added waiting for the Leonardo serial communication.
// 
//
// This sketch tests the standard 7-bit addresses
// Devices with higher bit address might not be seen properly.
//

#include <Wire.h>


void setup()
{
  Wire.begin();

  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial);             // Leonardo: wait for serial monitor
  Serial.println("\nI2C Scanner");
}


void loop()
{
  byte error, address;
  int nDevices;

  Serial.println("Scanning...");

  nDevices = 0;
  for(address = 1; address < 127; address++ ) 
  {
    // The i2c_scanner uses the return value of
    // the Write.endTransmisstion to see if
    // a device did acknowledge to the address.
    Wire.beginTransmission(address);
    error = Wire.endTransmission();

    if (error == 0)
    {
      Serial.print("I2C device found at address 0x");
      if (address<16) 
        Serial.print("0");
      Serial.print(address,HEX);
      Serial.println("  !");

      nDevices++;
    }
    else if (error==4) 
    {
      Serial.print("Unknown error at address 0x");
      if (address<16) 
        Serial.print("0");
      Serial.println(address,HEX);
    }    
  }
  if (nDevices == 0)
    Serial.println("No I2C devices found\n");
  else
    Serial.println("done\n");

  delay(5000);           // wait 5 seconds for next scan
}
```

After running the program, the address of the OLED display is 0x3C. **P.S.**: As long as two slave I2C devices don't have the same hardware address they both can use the same I2C lines; however, if there are two or more devices with the same address (usually happens with parts with the same number) a [multiplexer is needed](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-tca9548a-1-to-8-i2c-multiplexer-breakout/overview).


### Adafruit example program
The OLED display uses SSD1306 driver which is implemented by Adafruit. [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SSD1306/master/examples/ssd1306_128x32_i2c/ssd1306_128x32_i2c.ino) is an example prorgam that is supplied by Adafruit that uses the SSD1306 driver and [Adafruit's custom GFX library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library).

### Prototype version
In order to meet time constraints, I had to build out a prototype that worked somewhat as a watch. However, the 16MHz crystal oscillator found on the Arduino Uno development board is very inaccurate for real time keeping. By next week I am planning to use a [DS3231 RTC component for more accurate time keeping](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-ds3231-precision-rtc-breakout/overview). Here are the two versions of the demo I prepared for class for Thursday.

<video width="650" controls>
	<source src="demo1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
First demo that is just a counter counting up.

<video width="650" controls>
	<source src="demo2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
Second demo that is keeping the time.

Here is the code I used to program the second demo.

```cpp
// time.h
#pragma once

struct Time
{
  Time(unsigned int hours, unsigned int minutes, unsigned int seconds) 
  : hours(hours)
  , minutes(minutes)
  , seconds(seconds) {}

  Time() {}

  unsigned int hours;
  unsigned int minutes;
  unsigned int seconds;
  unsigned int millis;

  void addMillis(unsigned int millis) {
    this->millis += millis;

    seconds += this->millis / 1000;
    this->millis = this->millis % 1000;
    minutes += seconds / 60;
    seconds = seconds % 60;
    hours += minutes / 60;
    minutes = minutes % 60;    
    hours = hours % 24;
  }

  String toString() {
    return String() + hours + ":" + minutes + ":" + seconds;
  }
};

// ulysses.ino
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Wire.h>
#include "time.h"
#include <Adafruit_GFX.h>
#include <Adafruit_SSD1306.h>

#define WIDTH 128
#define HEIGHT 64

#define OLED_RESET -1

#define HEADER 'T'

Adafruit_SSD1306 display(WIDTH, HEIGHT, &Wire, OLED_RESET);
Time time(1, 4, 0);

unsigned long previousTime;

void setup()
{
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Initialize display
  if (!display.begin(SSD1306_SWITCHCAPVCC, 0x3C))
  {
    Serial.println(F("SSD1306 allocation failed"));
    for (;;)
    {
    } // stuck forever
  }

  // Clear the display of Adafruit logo
  display.clearDisplay();

  previousTime = millis();
}

void loop()
{
  // Update time
  updatetime();

  // Display time
  displaytime();
}

void updatetime()
{
  time.addMillis(millis() - previousTime);
  previousTime = millis();
}

void displaytime()
{
  display.clearDisplay();

  display.setTextSize(2);
  display.setTextColor(WHITE);
  display.setCursor(WIDTH / 2 - 50, HEIGHT / 2);
  display.println(time.toString());

  display.display();
}
```
