### CNC
[Computer Numerical Controlled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control) machinery uses machining tools through computer-generated codes. Such machining tools include drills, probes, lasers, boring tools, etc... CNC mills in particular use a set of motors to drive around an arm which is used to bore into material. CNC milling is a form of [subtractive manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machining) in contrast to 3D printing which is a form of [additive manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing). CNC mills works using a drill bit and cutting into a piece of material (usually organic matter).

The major variables that affect the speed and quality of the cut are "speeds and feeds". The speed portion of "speeds and feeds" refers to the cutting speed of the mill (or SFM) which is comparative to the surface of the material (expressed in m/min). The feed portion of "speeds and feeds" refers to the velocity which the cutter is moved along the material. The units are in inches per revolution.

The CNC mill that is available in the lab is a 8x4 feet Shopbot mill which is a 3-axis machine. 3-axis machines move along a Cartesian plane accoding to numerical instructions; however, unlike, the laser cutter they can move their depth (or z-axis) relative to the workspace plane. 4, 5, 6, and even 12-axis CNC mills exist that rotate the platform that the material sits on to cut. Adding more axes allows for more precise and detailed cuts; however, price and complexity grow with that added benefit. Therefore, for simplicity and cost efficiency, 3-axis machines will suffice for most consumer-level projects.

### Compositing
One use-case for the CNC mill is to create molds that can be used in casting or a process known as ["compositing"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material). Composites or composite materials are materials that are made from two or more materials in order to create a (usually) stronger material. Composites are composed of a matrix material and a fiber material. Real world examples of this are reinforced concrete which is made of concrete (fiber) and rebar (matrix) and plywood which is varied layered woods. In tommorrow's lab section, the composite will be composed of burlap/canvas (fiber) and [epoxy](#8c) resin (matrix). Coating the fiber in resin will increase its tensile strength and ultimately create a stiff mateiral. Multiple layers of resin-coated fiber will increase the stiffness. Composites are constructed through overlaying a mold with a release layer (typically saran wrap), then resin-coated fiber layers, a perforated bleeder layer (also usually saran wrap), a breather layer which the resin can seep into (usually cotton), and another release layer. Finally, the entire apparatus is thrown into a vacuum sealer in order to apply pressure and form the shape of the composite layer properly.

### Modelling
For the homework assignment due before this lab section, each group had to create CAD models in order to manufacture foam molds. My group decided to manufacture a scallop seashell. In order to create a complex shape with valleys and folds such as a seashell, I decided to use the [sculpt tool](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/inventor-products/learn-explore/caas/video/youtube/watch-v-LbzQW586rzs.html) in Fusion 360. First, I used the [canvas tool](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/fusion-360/learn-explore/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-Import-an-Image-as-an-Attached-Canvas.html) to overlay [an image](#8d) of a seashell as a reference drawing for sculpting. Then, through a rather long (and tedious) process, I began to use the Face and Edit Face tool under the Sculpt toolbox to create, rotate, and copy many faces that line up with the valleys and peaks of the seashell. Then I selected some of the vertices and translated them upwards in order to create a hills-and-valleys effect. Finally, I sketched a platform beneath the complete shell model and generated [this model](#8e).

Unfortunately, the overhangs under the shell creates issues for [subtractive manufacturing](#cnc). CNC mills are not able to accurately recreate the overhangs under the folds of the scallop shell, and regardless, those overhangs are not necessary for the [compositing](#compositing) process anyways. My group was unable to determine an easy, time-efficient solution for this problem using Fusion 360. Fortunately, Nathan and [Rhinoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_3D) were able to solve this issue. In Rhino, the shell model was imported as a [STEP file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_10303-21) and was represented as a polysurface object. Due to improper scaling (the shell was around 15mm in diameter), the first thing done was size the shell so it would fit the entirety of the 8x8 inch surface of the foam material. Then, the shell portion of the model was flipped so that the concaving side is facing towards the platform. This step was done due to the realization that the cast of the mold needs to be in the shape of a seashell, not the mold itself. Next, the concave side of the shell was extended downwards into the platform in order to eliminate the overhangs issue. An issue arose that the model was classified as an open polysurface. The open part means that some of the faces on the mesh are not actually connected in numerical code even if they visually seem to be. A way to eliminate this issue is to increase the tolerance of the polysurface. The tolerance property defines how close a face needs to be to another face in order to be considered joined; the higher this value is the less accurate the distance needs to be. Another way to eliminate this issue is by [exploding](https://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/5/help/en-us/commands/explode.htm) the model and manually adjusting each face so that they touch properly. Although my group was not able to entirely eliminate the "openness" of the polysurface, its accuracy was good enough so that a CNC machine would have no issue manufacturing the model.

### CNC
After modifying this object in Rhino, we imported the STL file into the V-Carve program on the workstation connected to the Shopbot CNC mill. The V-Carve program generates CNC code that gives instructions to the machine on what portion of the material needs to be milled. For most objects with curved surfaces, two passes are needed to successfully fabricate the mold with enough detail. A [rough pass](#8h) will sketch out the edges and general details of the shape, while a [smooth pass](#8i) will detail curves and handle rounder surfaces.

### Compositing
After succesfully cutting the mold of the [scallop shell](#8j), we proceeded onto the compositing step of the assignment. Due to the unique shape of the seashell mold, [cut strips of canvas coated in epoxy](#8k) were used as the first composite layer. Canvas was used because the burlap available in the lab was to tense to form folds over the small nuanced valleys of the shell; and we cut the canvas into strips so that the fabric will fold into the valleys better than a square sheet. Then, we overlay that layer with two square layers of epoxy-coated canvas in order to increase the durability of the cast. [Finally, we added a bleeder layer (which is perforated saran wrap), breather layer, and another release layer and placed the apparatus in a vacuum compressor.](#8l)

### Final Result
By the start of the next class session (i.e. 2019, July 25), the composite has finished the compression and drying process and is ready to be unpacked. After unpacking the top release layer of the composite, the square sheet that draped over the composite was stuck in place. As a result, the resulting composite needed to be trimmed using a pair of [shears](#8m). Afterwards, the resulting composite shell had captured some of the details of the vallyes of the seashell; however, the valleys did not dip as low as the ones reflected in the mold.
