### Wearable Electronics, Sewing, & Soft Robotics
Actuators in wearable electronics and soft robotics have the requirement that they need to be-- **soft**; the soft actuators shown in class use a composite of stretchy material overlayed with a balloon overlayed with non-tensile material. This allows the actuator to be soft on use, but also flexible. A tutorial on how to build a soft actuator can be found [here](https://softroboticstoolkit.com/textile-actuators).

In addition, sewing machines were introduced as a method of creating soft actuators. A zig-zag stitch was used as an example in class. On the Brother sewing machine, the bobbin and main spools need to be wound up before any operation. The bobbin outputs threading on the bottom of the textile while the main spool outputs thread from the top needle. The feed dogs on the bottom of the sewing machine helps move the textile and align the sweing machine. A counterstitch needs to be made at the beginning and end of a zig-zag stitch to avoid fabric from coming undone.

### Silicone Molding
For the second part of this section, Rob introduced a process that allows for easy copying of small physical objects. This process requires finding a container that can aptly hold the object to be copied. Equal parts of Oomoo<sup>TM</sup> solution A and B need to be mixed and poured into the container to create a negative mold of the object. After the mixed solutions cure (which forms a silicone solution), a mold can be extracted from the container after an hour. This mold can then be injected with metal or plaster to form a copy of the original object.

## 2019, July 31 (Wednesday Lab)
<sub>Note: Today, I spent much time soldering without the fan on and inhaled an excessive amount of the fumes released by the solder. As a result, I spent the reamining part of the lab very light-headed. I spent much of the time soldering for my final project (~1:30 to 2 hours) and very little time finishing the assignment.</sub>

### Velostat
As a requirement for my final project, I needed to some way to detect pressure (or rather some way to detect a finger being pressed against a surface) and, as a result of some research, I learned about velostat. Velostat is a material that is electrically conductive and changes its Ohmic resistance properties depending on how much pressure is applied to the material. As a proof-of-concept, I taped copper wire to both ends of the velostat material and used it similar to a resistor in a [voltage divider circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider). I used the [running average technique]({{ "/07" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to record the analog signal produced by flexing/stretching the velostat material.

Here is the exact code I used to read the analog signal:
```cpp
const int N = 100;
int curr = 0;
int sum = 0;
int arr[N];

void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(A0, INPUT);

  for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
    arr[i] = 0;
   }
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  int input = analogRead(A0);

  sum -= arr[curr];
  arr[curr] = input;
  sum += arr[curr];
  curr++;

  if (curr >= 100) {
    curr = 0;
  }
  
  Serial.println(sum / N);
}
```

### Sewing
As a part of my [final project]({{ "/12" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), I wished to sew velostat on a glove and read the resistance sewed onto each piece as a way to measure pressure applied on each finger and send that information to a receiver across an RF24 two-way radio. I sewed a piece of velostat and hard fabric together by creating a backstitch, lowering the main needle, lowering the pressure feet, using the peddle on the sewing machine to make a zig-zag stitch, and then ending with a backstitch.

### Complications
Due to massive frustration with getting the velostat to work properly with pieces of adhesive-backed copper, I attempted to use the copper wire found in the lab. The issue with velostat is that a wide enough surface area needs to be connected to conductors in order to have a reliable signal and I resolved that by looping copper wire on each side of the material and taping it using Scotch tape. Ultimately, however; I will attempt to use a [LDR/photoresistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor) surrounded by foam (to block out light from the sides), sewed onto the tip of each finger instead as a way to detect if a finger comes into contact (or at least close to) with another surface.
