### Using the Uno
As a warmup exercise, I first used an [Arduino Uno Rev.3 board](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3/) as a simple power source to light up a light-emitting diode by connecting the 5V pin in series with a red LED, then I connected the LED in series with resistors of different values (such as 1k or 100&#8486;).

### Blink program
Then, as another exercise I rewired the circuit so that the D8 pin was connected instead to the LED and ran a slightly modified version of [arduino.cc](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink)'s blink code. 

```cpp
/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

#define D8 8
#define LED D8

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED as an output.
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
```

### Soldering and Arduino Nano
The Arduino Nano board is a smaller form-factor alternative to the larger Arduino Uno alternatives. Asides from the small form factor, the Nano does not come with connector pins (unlike the female ones on the Uno board). For prototyping, I soldered male connector pins to the Nano board for use with a solderless breadboard.

For soldering, the iron must be preheated to hot temperatures (700-800&#176; F) to quickly melt a metal alloy (usually called solder) that usually has low melting points. The solder has a flux core which helps to form joints. If a solder joint is silvery and reflective, that is usually good indication that the joint will conduct well. To apply solder, use the iron to heat up the intersection of the two pieces _THEN_ apply and spread out the solder across the intersection.

### Tools
I used the Arduino Nano to play around with DC motors. Applying voltage to different terminals of the DC motors affects the direction in which the magnetic field is generated, which in turn affects the way the DC motor spins. To test values with the DC motor, I utilized a DC variable power supply. DC variable power supplies are able to control the voltage output from a certain range (here its from ~0-30V) or can even act as a current source (~0-5A). The DC supply reads the other non-used value (e.g. if you use it as a voltage source, then it works as a current reader).

Another useful tool for electronics is the digital multimeter. The digital multimeter has the ability to read both DC and AC signals and different Ohmic properties.
