# Introudction and Documentation

## 2019, June 25 (Tuesday Section)

Safety procedures:

- No dangling articles (such as lanyards and hair) in the lab
- Use safety goggles for using the CNC machines
- Close toed shoes
- Clean-up (ain't nobody gonna clean up your mess)

CNC + other machines:

- 3D Printers
- Laser Cutter
- Vinyl Cutter

### Using the Uno

As a warmup exercise, I first used an [Arduino Uno Rev.3 board](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3/) as a simple power source to light up a light-emitting diode by connecting the 5V pin in series with a red LED, then I connected the LED in series with resistors of different values (such as 1k or 100&#8486;).


### Blink program

Then, as another exercise I rewired the circuit so that the D8 pin was connected instead to the LED and ran a slightly modified version of [arduino.cc](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink)'s blink code.

```cpp
/*
  Blink

  Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

  Most Arduinos have an on-board LED you can control. On the UNO, MEGA and ZERO
  it is attached to digital pin 13, on MKR1000 on pin 6. LED_BUILTIN is set to
  the correct LED pin independent of which board is used.
  If you want to know what pin the on-board LED is connected to on your Arduino
  model, check the Technical Specs of your board at:

#define D8 8
#define LED D8

// the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
  pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                       // wait for a second
}
```
