## Hello,
My name is Kosi Nwabueze. I am a Nigerian-American from the San Fernando Valley in Southern California. As a result of this course, I hope to take acquired skills to assist in completing some of my dream hobby projects. These include building an old homebrew style computer from scratch using the Z80 processor (which I am familiar with after emulating it in a [Gameboy emulator](https://github.com/kosinw/Castor)) and building a learning platform for video game development that utilizes a Raspberry PI running custom bare metal assembly and a programmable Lua interpreter. My experience in programming languages range from building web applications using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) alongside HTML5 technologies, building applications using [C++](https://github.com/kosinw/chip_eight), using Java in AP Computer Science A, using [SQL, C#, and Javascript to build an n-tiered application](https://github.com/kosinw/battleships), playing around with [Rust](https://github.com/kosinw/advent-of-code-2017), and my .NET experience using [C#](https://github.com/kosinw/Castor).

## My final project ideas include:  
- [orpheus](https://github.com/kosinw/orpheus) - A programmable, handheld video game console that utilizes a Lua interpreter for ease of learning.
- A wearable monitor for toothbrushing activity
- A device that transforms humming/singing into a melody playable through a MIDI device
- A device that transforms taps into a drum instrument through a MIDI interface
- A wearable device that acts as an efficient planner / notetaking application similar to [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/)
