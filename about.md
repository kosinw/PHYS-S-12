## Hello,

My name is Kosi Nwabueze. From the city of Chatsworth, California, I invest in Computer Science related hobbies and extracurriculars. From Capture-the-Flag challenges in cybersecurity to launching a project in a quick 36-hour hackathon, I love to regularly compete and promote such events. From this course (that is PHYS S-12), I hope to take the skills I learned in this course to help complete some of my dream hobby projects. These include building an old homebrew style computer from scratch using the Z80 processor (which I am familiar with after emulating it in a [Gameboy emulator](https://github.com/kosinw/Castor)) and building a learning platform for video game development that utilizes a Raspberry PI running custom bare metal assembly and a programmable Lua interpreter.

## My final project ideas include:
- [orpheus](https://github.com/kosinw/orpheus) - A programmable, handheld video game console that utilizes a Lua interpreter for ease of learning.
- A wearable monitor for toothbrushing activity
- A device that transforms humming/singing into a melody playable through a MIDI device
- A wearable device that acts as an efficient planner / notetaking application similar to [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/)
